# Homebridge Service

This package contains a simple [Homebridge](https://homebridge.io) service implementation that can control Homebridge switches.  In my personal setup, this is used in place of SSRs to control pumps and heating elements.  [Zigbee switches](https://www.ikuu.com.au/product/double-power-point-ip54/) have been installed and integrated with Homebridge via [Zigbee2MQTT](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io) and [homebridge-z2m](https://z2m.dev)
